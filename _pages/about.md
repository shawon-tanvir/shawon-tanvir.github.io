Greetings!!!

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

I am Md. Tanvir Rouf Shawon, a Lecturer, at <a href="http://aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST)</a>, Dhaka, Bangladesh in the <a href="https://www.aust.edu/cse">Department of CSE</a>. I have completed B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="http://aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST)</a>, Dhaka, Bangladesh. My primary research interest lies in Computer Vision, Generative Adversarial Networks, Semi-Supervised Learning, Image Processing, Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning Applications, and Deep Learning.<br /><br/>

I have worked on several research projects involving computer vision and natural language processing, and I am currently involved in a number of projects that collaborate with several academic talents. As an AUST lecturer, I am currently facilitating the Soft Computing course that includes artificial neural networks, deep learning models and fuzzy systems. I always make an effort to encourage my students to carry out in-depth research and explore cutting-edge technologies. I have gathered a great experience working on a funded project collaborating with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pBArY-sAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Md. Shahriar Mahbub</a>. Details of the project can be found <a href="https://shawon-tanvir.github.io/publications/">here</a>.  <br /><br/>
